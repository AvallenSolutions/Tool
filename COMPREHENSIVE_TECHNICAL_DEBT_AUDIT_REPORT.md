3. **Caching Architecture Conflicts**
   - Dual cache services (LCACacheService + RedisLCACacheService)
   - Inconsistency risks between memory and Redis caching

### ⚡ PHASE 5: PERFORMANCE & RELIABILITY

**PERFORMANCE BOTTLENECKS:**

1. **Bundle Size Issues**
   - Client bundle: 2.63MB (target: <500KB)
   - No code splitting implementation
   - 170+ dependencies loaded

2. **Memory Usage**
   - BrowserPoolService: 4GB+ RAM per instance
   - 51 services with inconsistent instantiation patterns

3. **Build Performance**
   - 21.78s production build time
   - 3,606 modules transformed
   - Large chunk warnings

4. **Database Performance**
   - Complex aggregation queries with multiple LEFT JOINs
   - CAST operations in aggregations
   - Missing query optimization
