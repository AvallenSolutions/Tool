Calculating the waste footprint correctly is a common point of confusion. The key, according to all major standards like the GHG Protocol and ISO 14040 series, is to separate the waste generated during production from the waste created at the product's end-of-life.

1. Production Waste Footprint
This is the waste generated in your own facility or your contract manufacturer's facility before the product is sold. This includes things like ingredient off-cuts, packaging rejects, or processing residues.

Methodology
The standard approach is a direct allocation based on your company's total waste data.

Collect Annual Data: In the 'Company Data' section of your tool, you should already be collecting the total weight of waste generated by the facility, broken down by disposal route (e.g., landfill, recycling, composting). This is the user's primary data.

Calculate Intensity: The tool should calculate a "waste intensity factor" by dividing the total annual waste by the total annual production volume.

Example: 10,000 kg of waste / 20,000 LPA produced = 0.5 kg of waste per LPA.

Allocate to Product: The tool then allocates a proportional slice of that total waste to the individual product based on its production volume (e.g., the amount of pure alcohol in one bottle).

This method ensures that the product's production waste footprint is a direct, evidence-based reflection of the facility's real-world performance.

2. End-of-Life Waste Footprint
This is the waste footprint of the product's packaging after the consumer has used it. This is where methodologies can get complex, but the standard approach is clear.

Methodology
The standard is the "cut-off" approach, which is used by default in databases like Ecoinvent. This method avoids making assumptions about future recycling.

Calculate Disposal Emissions: The tool calculates the emissions based on the probable fate of the packaging. It uses national or regional statistics for waste streams.

Example (for a glass bottle in the UK):

(75% recycling rate * Emissions from transport & processing at a recycling facility)

+ (25% landfill rate * Emissions from transport & disposal in a landfill)

No "Recycling Credit": Crucially, you do not subtract a credit for the material that is recycled. The environmental benefit of that recycled glass is allocated to the next company that buys and uses it as a raw material. This prevents double-counting the benefit.

This methodology provides a realistic footprint of the product's end-of-life stage based on the current waste infrastructure, without pre-claiming a future benefit that isn't guaranteed.
