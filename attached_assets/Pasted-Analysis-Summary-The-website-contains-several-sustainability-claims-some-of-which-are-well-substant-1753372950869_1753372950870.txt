The website contains several sustainability claims, some of which are well-substantiated, while others require additional evidence or clarification to comply with the DMCC 2024 anti-greenwashing requirements. Specific attention should be given to providing third-party verification and detailed data for claims related to carbon footprint and climate positivity.
